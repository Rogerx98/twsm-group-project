       " \"Click's business model is made possible by the fact that telecommunications infrastructure promises even better opportunities for measuring media consumption than internet servers.\",\n",
       " 'A telecommunications network can largely automate the painstaking data capture that underpins audience measurement but also links every action to an individual consumer.',\n",
       " 'The mobile network infrastructure consists of hundreds of components that store log files known as Call Detail Records (CDRs) of every call, click, and message relayed through the network, constantly producing large amounts of detailed data on individual subscriber behavior.',\n",
       " \"While similar to server access logs used to capture people's web browsing habits, CDRs also identify the individual consumer by an MSISDN 2 that is unique to a SIM card.\",\n",
       " 'CDR data tokens are thus a seemingly potent resource that can provide, in principle, the full picture of what each individual subscriber does in the channel-even beyond that which is possible on the internet.',\n",
       " 'A concise overview of offline, internet, and mobile advertising measurement approaches can be found in Appendix 3.',\n",
       " 'The company initially offered 43 free voice call minutes and 217 text messages for eligible 16-to 24-year-old subscribers to build up the consumer side of the platform and an attractive audience for advertisers.',\n",
       " 'On the advertiser side, there had been limited trials before the commercial launch, but a definitive validation of the effectiveness of the new advertising channel required data from real consumers interacting with advertisements.',\n",
       " 'In this sense, the company was initially selling a product that was hardly more than a promise that advertising messages delivered to mobile phones would carve out a receptive audience from its network subscribers.',\n",
       " 'The lack of data from real advertising operations made it difficult to articulate the audience product to advertisers and convince them to try Click-despite all the potential advantages of CDRs and other data available to the company.',\n",
       " 'Given the lack of an established measurement regime for the type of advertising slots Click was trying to sell, the company had to repeatedly relay advertisements to its subscribers, collect data from their reception, and try to articulate these data in ways that advertisers would recognize as a valuable audience.',\n",
       " 'This is illustrated by the following excerpt from a press release:',\n",
       " 'Click, the new mobile network for 16-24 years old funded by advertising, has signed up over 100,000 members since its launch in [country] at the end of September, 2007 . . . .',\n",
       " 'The ad campaigns that fund the service have generated industry leading average response rates of 29%, at a time when trust in other forms of mass advertising is falling and brands are finding it increasingly difficult to engage with young people.',\n",
       " 'One and half years into the operations, Click was able to start arguing that mobile network subscribers can make a viable advertising audience, based on data from initially heavily subsidized campaigns and, for instance, by publishing marketing case studies to make new advertising opportunities salient.',\n",
       " 'The size of the potential audience that was reachable through the new channel was still relatively small for the respective media market, but the rate at which audience members responded to advertising can be considered high compared to any other marketing channel.',\n",
       " 'Importantly, the previously mentioned press release uses metrics such as \"100,000 members\" and \"average response rates of 29%\" to describe the audience.',\n",
       " \"These measures are critical for advertisers to be able to perceive Click's subscribers as a commodified audience.\",\n",
       " 'By the time we entered the setting in February 2009, Click had doubled its subscriber base, and advertising sales were steadily growing.',\n",
       " \"Click's most popular advertising formats are one-way push messages to subscribers and a three-step dialogue that starts with a message requesting a reply and then provides a tailored feedback message to those who respond to the initial message.\",\n",
       " 'It is notable that the three-step dialogue is only possible due to the extremely granular, census-like CDR data that reveal the reception and responses for each message sent to every individual subscriber, making the mobile channel \"the only media that enable direct, immediate dialogue with consumers,\" as a Brand Office employee argued in a workshop on the company\\'s market positioning.',\n",
       " 'Once an advertising campaign finishes, a sales manager uses an advertising reporting system to create a post-campaign report to communicate the campaign metrics to the client.',\n",
       " 'The report, which consists of a detailed breakdown of advertising operations with various metrics for each message sent to and received from target subscribers, is a critical artifact in the process of verifying the commodity that was delivered to the client.',\n",
       " 'In the following three subsections, we temporally bracket recurrent operations (e.g., the production of metrics) and idiosyncratic events (e.g., a transition to a new consumer offer) to illustrate how the data commodity is produced.',\n",
       " 'A capacity to demonstrate that consumers remain responsive to advertisements is contingent on managing hundreds of mobile network elements that produce nearly one million Call Detail Records (CDRs) every day.',\n",
       " 'Individual network elements store CDRs in text files that are collected daily in a large relational database where the records can be centrally accessed, aggregated, and filtered in a number of ways.',\n",
       " \"The records store the time and type of the network operation, its endpoints (MSISDNs), and a few other details about an exchange between two subscribers or between a subscriber and Click's advertising engine.\",\n",
       " 'Whatever information an individual CDR token encodes, it is both highly decontextualized and extremely granular:',\n",
       " \"The content of the CDR shows that the 'raw' data obtained from the network infrastructure are no more than strings of alphanumeric characters with minimal context.\",\n",
       " 'The implicit data fields are generic in nature (ID, type, MSISDN, time, etc.), which makes the data tokens individually rather meaningless to the business.',\n",
       " 'Importantly, the data do not represent an audience but do represent microscopic network exchanges that lack any perceivable information about advertising campaign performance.',\n",
       " 'The records can nevertheless be aggregated along dimensions represented by the data fields, allowing to observe patterns and, subsequently, to contextualize the patterns using unique IDs that the tokens carry.',\n",
       " 'The ID allows for mapping the data token to an advertisement, while the MSISDN code identifies a SIM card that belongs to a specific subscriber.',\n",
       " 'The central database feeds numerous analytical tools and systems that are used by the Commercial, Members, and Operations teams.',\n",
       " 'The main systems for analyzing the reception and responses to advertising messages are an in-house-built advertising engine that manages message delivery and member interactions, and two different reporting tools that create campaign reports for clients.',\n",
       " 'A key feature of these systems is that they implement the metrics for advertising reach and consumer responsiveness based on algorithms that aggregate CDRs so that contextually relevant questions can be answered from the data: How many people received an advertisement?',\n",
       " 'How large a portion of the recipients responded to an advertisement?',\n",
       " 'How large is the total audience available to receive advertisements through Click?',\n",
       " \"The ability to construct convincing answers to such questions allows Click to argue that it indeed 'has' an audience.\",\n",
       " 'To this end, the metrics in the post-campaign report may seem technically trivial to calculate, but at the same time they entail laborious negotiations and work to counter inherent ambiguities that emerge as the data are aggregated.',\n",
       " 'The size of the audience for an individual advertisement, what is commonly defined as the reach of advertising, is seemingly simple to calculate from the data.',\n",
       " 'However, on a closer inspection, it turns out that the metric can refer to at least two different things: the number of advertising messages delivered and the number of different consumers contacted.',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, the two measures are different from the number of messages sent.',\n",
       " \"A message may be delivered by the network infrastructure immediately, with a delay, or it may not be delivered at all to the subscriber's mobile phone.\",\n",
       " 'The ambiguities accumulate even further in the case of advertising formats that are based on several exchanges with each recipient.',\n",
       " 'A three-step dialogue-type advertisement entails sending multiple messages to the same consumer-some of the messages are never delivered, and some that are delivered could be counted either once or more than once, depending on the interpretation of the metric.',\n",
       " \"For instance, did a subscriber 'see' the advertisement if he or she received only the first part of a three-step dialogue?\",\n",
       " 'Due to these and other differences in underlying technologies and the data, the metrics cannot be copied from other media channels.',\n",
       " 'The underlying ambiguity about defining an audience is reflected in the shifting labeling of the metric that is alternatively known as \"delivered,\" \"delivered contacts,\" or \"contacts\" in documents produced by different employees at different times.',\n",
       " 'The response rate is the rate at which subscribers respond to advertising messages sent to their phones.',\n",
