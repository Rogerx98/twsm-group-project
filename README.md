Sentence Classification Problem: How do we know what a sentence is about?

Problem: 
The meaning of an entity in a paper depends on the sentence and the context.
E.g. research method in related work is not describing the focal paper but a different paper.

Task:
Classification of sentences in research papers (multi-class- or multi-label problem)
Creation of open access corpus
